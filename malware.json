Specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp could cause a denial-of-service condition in the EN100 communication module if oscillographs are running. A manual restart is required to recover the EN100 module functionality. Successful exploitation requires an attacker with network access to send multiple packets to the EN100 module. As a precondition the IEC 61850-MMS communication needs to be activated on the affected EN100 modules. No user interaction or privileges are required to exploit the security vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow causing a Denial-of-Service condition of the network functionality of the device, compromising the availability of the system.

The vulnerability could impact the perceived integrity of the user program stored on the CPU.

As of April 26, 2002, there are nine variants of the Klez worm that all exploit the \"Microsoft Internet Explorer Incorrect MIME header\" vulnerability, which causes an email attachment to be automatically executed when an HTML email is previewed by a Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express user. The worm can arrive as an email attachment with one of the following file extensions: asp, bak, c, cpp, doc, htm, html, jpg, mp3, mpg, mpeg, pas, rtf, wab, or xls.W32.Sircam.Worm [Symantec-2001-071720-1640-99] - a computer worm that propagates by e-mail from Microsoft Windows systems. It also spreads via open shares on a network. Sircam scans the network for computers with shared drives and copy itself to a machine with an open (non-password protected) drive or directory. Buffer overflow in a certain driver in Cisco Security Agent 4.5.1 before 4.5.1.672, 5.0 before 5.0.0.225, 5.1 before 5.1.0.106, and 5.2 before 5.2.0.238 on Windows allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted SMB packet in a TCP session on port (1) 139 or (2) 445.References: [CVE-2007-5580] [BID-26723] [SECUNIA-27947] [OSVDB-39521]Server Message Block (SMB) also uses this port.
